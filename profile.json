Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight.

It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only.

If there's no `config` folder, create one.\n- Open `fabric_loader_dependencies.json` inside `config` folder. If there's no `fabric_loader_dependencies.json` file, create one.\n- Paste the following text inside:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"chunksfadein\": {\n      \"+depends\": {\n        \"embeddium\": \">0.2.18+mc1.20.1\"\n      },\n      \"-depends\": {\n        \"sodium\": \"IGNORED\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n- Save the file and restart/launch the game.\n- Done!\n\n# Features\n## Showcase\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CanA5ADOis0\">\n</iframe>\n\n## Flexible config with Mod Menu support!\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/blob/main/readme-assets/config.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">","published":"2022-12-04T17:38:44.944066Z","updated":"2024-06-14T16:55:51.798446Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":341305,"followers":921,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration","game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["hEplZtg0","KJNlvXs4","JUS3uOQj","mwZ79PNk","CNlaXfoU","zal4toW9","V07HmAQL","CYYu4Jdv","4dvYdTtV","UzboZpag","xOscM10S","i5fPLkvN","MxfDZffU","dSrsmT8V","d96KPSMT","n5Px2K9p","xYqeXu1V","IlFmvKEE","sf57ybJ5","qTAQmsC2","UBGBOzFy","VMGkV4GJ","Ic6wAVB0","JbGM3yfS","zjkLzsMF","iFcLLQFI","L5P3GlJd","Dm49FIFV","xoi9FwQ1","U9LXbQiq","iCsaIPkc","NRcn8zRv","4A9JTT7P","1MVqFeuW","ELVmwkr2","fNIKQ1iq","iFdj0jQT","V4Xydbrm","PGqpUEhW","aItOAKVN","EvgXpevG","ZGLPcJEK","iHTbrdPv","15vyEm1W","DLsWr0Om","l93ndBxU","WllUavRq","6eaReL7j","ksY4JosB","TmMsFGWm","uEHUQ9tW","GzCXUfbp","93ILsQAj","3R6zUuhL","FHldinWI","gr61TaqK","XddlRahr","MjAt9FVE","vySrSZST","PGlH4K9i","vKsmwuM6","eiJDsAQk","16SoZEWM","QrVXrdT3","INLnTyVe"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JaNmzvA8/e9b2e86179280fc209c0cbc5de36b5946fc7cb50.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"INLnTyVe","project_id":"JaNmzvA8","author_id":"4UUDD3CQ","featured":false,"name":"v1.0.0-1.21","version_number":"1.0.0-1.21","changelog":"- Added support for 1.21","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-14T16:55:54.234675Z","downloads":10335,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f4bbebae31df0e61cd6e424090e1eb79c96511adff244a63596023bf6dca1a36603429228c0d14309e28a09cadae8b9d228244bac8242e18822ea243bfe488dd","sha1":"e064202232aa9a1d5cda981740464877e2cf1a2d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JaNmzvA8/versions/INLnTyVe/chunksfadein-1.0.0-1.21.jar","filename":"chunksfadein-1.0.0-1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":310628,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"01d0716bd36b5b7107c7674f3e7d25e346a09c16","sha512":"15de047bf59e2197ff27e97755a23241ca2cf8b6eac1b26db09637af1e8ce03ee63f37532a27c1267be834833c427fbfc04ea38ba9ce0500a89da2c04bc002aa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JaNmzvA8/versions/INLnTyVe/chunksfadein-1.0.0-1.21-sources.jar","filename":"chunksfadein-1.0.0-1.21-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":182719,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"YL57xq9U","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"xNqnrvWG","user":{"id":"4UUDD3CQ","username":"kerudion","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/4UUDD3CQ/47f366ca6f1e653cd6c40b56de25e172d2cafbca.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-04T17:38:12.735210Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"chunksfadein-1.0.0-1.21.jar"},"resourcepacks\\Chat Reporting Helper.zip":{"sha512":"c56d76387a18a92be4725a4b0caa6c5e849d26271a62f8affc2c20d0f06bcf76189c85b16d8dd9f975f7ccad6d9d5186171753d165e4f4487a57497865ce3a6f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"tN4E9NfV","slug":"chat-reporting-helper","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"hXhZpGSJ","title":"Chat Reporting Helper","description":"An educational tool that explains chat reporting in a simple and neutral way.","body":"**As seen on [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized)!**\n\nMinecraft's default in-game wording about chat reportability is technical, confusing and gives the assumption that chat reportability exists in every server. [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)' wording is also technical, biased towards negativity and very detailed.\nThis resource pack fixes both by replacing those phrases with simple and unbiased, yet accurate phrases.\n\n### What this resource pack does\n\n- Change the tooltips on vanilla report buttons and chat indicators\n- Change the \"messages can't be verified\" warning toast\n- Change the \"Only Show Secure Chat\" label and tooltip\n- Change the description on vanilla report textbox\n- Change the status icons and tooltips on [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)\n- Ensures the phrases are short, clear and non-technical\n- [Is available in several languages](https://crowdin.com/project/fabulously-optimized)\n- Is an educational tool, not a protective one\n- Focuses on practical use cases and actual server behavior, not theoretical possibilities\n- Serve as an example and call to Mojang to improve transparency and clarity regarding this feature in the game\n\n<details>\n<summary>What this resource pack doesn't do</summary>\n\n- State, whether chat reportability is good or bad\n- Obstruct or mislead the meaning of any phrase\n- Edit the report icon or \"Player reporting\" button\n- Edit report or ban reasons\n- Edit the ban screen\n- Hide vanilla indicators or warning toast\n- Replicate the features of [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) or any other mod or plugin\n\n</details>\n\n### What do the icons mean?\n\nThe icons are only shown when you have [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) installed. For vanilla chat indicators, hover the gray box on the left.\n\n- ![unknown](https://i.ibb.co/Yb1n6fW/unknown.png) - status not yet known, you must send one chat message to get it\n- ![disabled](https://i.ibb.co/QDFzXCT/secure.png) - no chat messages can be reported to Mojang\n- ![optional](https://i.ibb.co/hstcjW7/neutral.png) - most chat messages can be reported to Mojang, but the server does not prefer it and the playing user opts out\n   - In some cases, no messages can be reported but that is not reflected on the icon. You can confirm by seeing if you can report anyone on Social Interactions.\n- ![enabled](https://i.ibb.co/2YgMHpR/insecure.png) - all chat messages can be reported to Mojang\n- ![realms](https://i.ibb.co/gTxw84X/realms.png) - only on Realms: all chat messages can be reported to Mojang and [Mojang is passively monitoring the chat for violations](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/8047895358605-Our-Commitment-to-Player-Safety#h_01G95X76WR1PM97XBXDE7G25KE)\n\n### Who is this resource pack for\n\n- Users, who don't understand how chat reportability works\n- Users, who don't understand when and where chat reportability works\n- Users, who are positive, neutral or slightly concerned about chat reportability \n- Users, who don't understand the technical terms of vanilla or [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)\n- Modpacks, that have been afraid to include [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) due to potential confusion or bias\n- Modpacks, that want to ensure users know about chat reportability and where it works\n- Parents, who want to ensure their children play on servers that enforce chat reportability\n- Realm owners, who want to know the limitations and requirements of Realms\n- Server owners, who enforce chat reportability and want to ensure users know how it works\n\n### Even more questions\n\n> **Q**: Do I have to use this with [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)?\n>\n> **A**: No, though it is recommended to get more accurate status icons.\n\n> **Q**: Do I have to configure No Chat Reports a certain way to benefit from this?\n>\n> **A:** It has to be enabled and not whitelisting by default to get the indicator icons, any other changes are up to you. You may configure it to skip prompts automatically (set \"Default signing mode\" to \"On Demand\") to make the experience smoother.\n\n> **Q**: Should I install No Chat Reports if I like chat reportability?\n>\n> **A**: Yes, it is still recommended, as it is currently the only way to get a consistent indicator about the system being active on the server. Remember, the mod always respects the server's intent and does not contain any hacks or exploits.\n\n> **Q**: Why is this not in No Chat Reports itself?\n>\n> **A**: No Chat Reports' default phrases do a better job at describing the technical details and giving users traffic light-like indicators to assist on _avoiding_ chat reports. This resource pack is meant to be a more neutral approach similar to [Steam's \"VAC-secured\" indicator](https://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q3/Sierra_Oscar_2006/VAC2w.jpg) - any user can make their own call on whether seeing the shield icon is a bad or good thing. I really hope Mojang will implement something like this in the vanilla game one day.\n> \n> Edit: [Mojang implemented a similar badge](https://findmcserver.com/parents#features) in their new online server list, but not yet in-game and no Java Edition servers have it.\n\n> **Q**: Does this replace every chat reportability-related phrase and icon?\n>\n> **A**: No, only the minimum that is required for clear understanding.\n\n> **Q**: What about skin and username reporting?\n>\n> **A**: As of version 3.0, the pack has been updated to reflect the new reporting selection screen. However, most of the features of this resource pack are still only focused on chat.\n\n> **Q**: I don't see the changed phrase where I should see it.\n>\n> **A**: That might be due to a lack of resource pack translation in your language, so default phrases are displayed as a fallback. [Please contribute!](https://crowdin.com/project/fabulously-optimized)\n\n> **Q**: Can I contribute translations to my language?\n>\n> **A**: Yes, please do! [Join the Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/fabulously-optimized) and start translating.\n\n> **Q**: Where can I learn more about player reporting?\n>\n> **A**: [I have made a detailed writeup for my modpack Fabulously Optimized.](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/chat-reporting-faq)\n\n> **Q**: Backports?\n>\n> **A**: No. This is intended for Minecraft 1.19.4 and up, because both Minecraft and No Chat Reports have made some drastic changes compared to 1.19.3 and older.","published":"2023-04-29T11:40:58.149297Z","updated":"2024-06-10T18:29:25.266401Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1094106,"followers":103,"categories":["locale","simplistic","vanilla-like"],"additional_categories":["16x","gui","modded","realistic","tweaks"],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["minecraft"],"versions":["JXC01pGv","CqQiUzNM","LoxAg64O","861KZZWZ","6z8xjGCu","fbSsMgUv","aPm7UDFh","HMuz0tyU","Kf69ojWs","lW34Xt8V","LZhXI7Oz","vNwSJbfg","w6iUqgiI","L6ypR15j","NCVUlRX8","aWvPAmE8","Bltq5GHv","DRaVYgzW","i6BLAbO7","QagPtxqs","KxIfCcXu","dnv1Qtty","JDkny3WI","F8O2jslS","7zxgLdb2","JymGii0x","gQYPMAdZ","ow6CfFvU","quDOG96q","sKEVyFr2","lqCTic2a","haXf0NKx","fBHcTlZz","3LHRFVZw","Srwwuu3m","mD4cUkN5","2vSy3UV7","tDqbwxyq","1SHtlNIB","M75CMzeC","pXplWXNs","8kFpMqys","KWSVmakf","SkWcZo5g","ZoKnhKiU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tN4E9NfV/c2d93fd85469a512f67e53baa7648c1abe6645ef.png"},"version":{"id":"ZoKnhKiU","project_id":"tN4E9NfV","author_id":"2avTeeAE","featured":true,"name":"4.18","version_number":"4.18","changelog":"Compatible

Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n###

have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n#### Translators\nLanguages in alphabetical order\n\n- [神枪968](https://github.com/GodGun968) - 简体中文 / Chinese (Simplified)\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - English (United Kingdom)\n- [Madis0](https://github.com/Madis0) - eesti keel / Estonian\n- [co-91](https://github.com/co-91) - 日本語 / Japanese\n- [Rodrigo Appelt](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Português / Portuguese\n- [SyberiaK](https://github.com/SyberiaK) - Русский / Russian\n- [Felix14-v2](https://github.com/Felix14-v2) - Русский / Russian\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (mexicano) / Spanish (Mexico)\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (españa) / Spanish (Spain)\n- [localfossa](https://github.com/localfossa) - Türkçe / Turkish\n- [Im Vietnam](https://github.com/ImVietnam) - Tiếng Việt / Vietnamese\n","published":"2022-01-29T20:52:18.744493Z","updated":"2024-06-17T23:37:55.523743Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3835244,"followers":3011,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["iVw60IvO","cgp0M9ZD","gUBtDUBp","4Kmn0eeU","p4qDdICN","87tTbECt","Z7VJkXXa","2ZC7Fxc8","jfoKe5Fr","HDVevQGA","Dqby42rh","ywAz0NBY","LropUbSI","yRrEHsQ0","qJLT1UZa","t2MUOMy5","IjbCI21q","ClfJLhWu","ssxmDm4w","3bwXGtwH","vdNR7RSe","VqJlUKUp","BrGdvUUq","zS4oS6ht","sC6H3PnU","TQKBOZaT","nls01OIv","f017okM4","YHh8fxDi","p5RjeOJL","mIiMyney","1mKrqlvv","tv8GIQDa","1AYfSJ9O","gZr7EykF","QRQLkNPJ","JiEpJuon","8cY8HQIg","BalILUb7","LIBdkZvZ","FiLFLGIB","VfWNmPC4","eLEIUtBo","8BIz17tA","OggLUOr6","66iHgfN8","vg7GaKbh","twJQAslW","hzEfkIGF","8VBKUY5S"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/25d48c335340c12566044c8f35df5102e72dc06c.png"},"version":{"id":"vg7GaKbh","project_id":"w7ThoJFB","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"Zoomify 2.14.0 for MC 1.21","version_number":"2.14.0+1.21","changelog":"# Zoomify 2.14.0\n\nZoomify now targets the following Minecraft versions:\n\n- 1.20.1\n- 1.20.4 (also supports 1.20.3)\n- 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)\n- 1.21\n\nMake sure you download the correct version for your Minecraft version!\n\n## Changes\n\n- Presets now have demo animations in their descriptions\n- 1.21 support\n- Internally rewrite settings with new experimental YetAnotherConfigLib API\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-17T23:35:31.442674Z","downloads":158866,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d85b3c7817dabe7507b974e8626fa1023177755c50698a3bb2ba41398f1130b4c84b31aa8b51488f70ed84cfd56f29e245b32f21ca332e2ef24d97979df51f6e","sha1":"7adcde4ce0861c6b573bc86615a19ccf17bec255"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/versions/vg7GaKbh/Zoomify-2.14.0%2B1.21.jar","filename":"Zoomify-2.14.0+1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":809543,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"VAryyl46","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Zoomify-2.14.0+1.21.jar"},"mods\\cloth-config-15.0.127-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"b3059112661363955aa77f3cdc2993e7875089f6415179351869febd4bd35a221b75001ab4698e6105f3c0241698d0ffce645b5cae7fe9f90bdb3b96b74691d2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9s6osm5g","slug":"cloth-config","project_type":"mod","team":"z9omIQMN","title":"Cloth Config API","description":"Configuration Library for Minecraft Mods","body":"[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZEORx0F.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"/>](https://discord.gg/Vs9AVkxjYY) [<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LrVLC2a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\"/>](https://www.patreon.com/shedaniel)\n\nCloth Config API is a config screen api.\n\n### Developers Wiki\n[https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/](https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/)\n\nNeed a server to play with friends?

Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n\n### [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is required to use EBE with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium). <br/><br/> \n**Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)**\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests have glitched animations!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using Sodium, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use Sodium with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You may be using a resource pack that conflicts with EBE. Open the Block Entity Settings menu (through EBE's Mod Menu entry or through vanilla Video Settings) and enable \"Force Resource Pack Compatibility\". <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n- Decorated Pots\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2024-06-13T19:44:57.246192Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2940639,"followers":3398,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq","xeHyTMq8","Ihazqamt","xUOoKrs2","BKpMtYZB","8OuTJDGd"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"8OuTJDGd","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.10.1 for 1.21","version_number":"0.10.1+1.21","changelog":"- Update to 1.21\n- Block atlas changes during resource reloads should no longer corrupt animated block entity models","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-13T19:44:58.337205Z","downloads":203319,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"23c603c88532206cae4400e3eea5dea220d5d328b5dc27d3a550fa1b31c27639744592e9f2e888536b6ed529c13e2c95465b98413c55157de45f3ecc5daa02bc","sha1":"36045df5f1b3e7645a5dd450fa305a8134dd7c51"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/8OuTJDGd/enhancedblockentities-0.10.1%2B1.21.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.10.1+1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":200698,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.10.1+1.21.jar"},"mods\\Xaeros_Minimap_24.2.1_Fabric_1.21.jar":{"sha512":"164108c3d0a56a23868e307b08f2042460cd85fb508437579a3f410517f714984610845b052f6218d5e60578466e41ec7df8bbbe6d6abeccc7a7c103987daae0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"1bokaNcj","slug":"xaeros-minimap","project_type":"mod","team":"9lteWJca","title":"Xaero's Minimap","description":"Displays a map of the nearby world terrain, players, mobs, entities in the corner of your screen.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen.

For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount.

If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

collection, aka telemetry, introduced in Minecraft 1.18 [(snapshot 21w38a)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w38a#main-content).\n\n\nThe feature previously existed from Minecraft 1.3.1 to 1.12 as [Snooper](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Snooper), but was removed in 1.13 [(snapshot 18w21a)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-130179) as it did not comply with European Union's General Data Protection Regulations.\n\nIn 1.18 it was re-added. You would expect it would be done in a more compliant way... However, from my understanding of GDPR, this is even less compliant than the original Snooper was.  \nInstead of being anonymous/pseudonymous (at least, the ids in the snooper screen don't match my user id), it now sends the XUID, your Xbox user id, in plain text... which means this data can be traced back to your user.\n\nIt now sends the following data when loading a singleplayer world or connecting to a multiplayer server:\n\n* launcher identifier\n* user identitifer/XUID (**this can be used to identify you**)\n* client session id (changes on restart)\n* world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)\n* game version\n* operating system name and version\n* Java runtime version\n* if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)\n* server type (single player, Realms or other)\n* game mode\n\nThis time [Mojang did not add a toggle](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237493) for interested users to turn it off, though, so this mod fixes that by disabling the telemetry entirely.\n\n#### License\n\nThis mod is available under the CC0 license.","published":"2021-09-24T00:35:49.147867Z","updated":"2023-12-14T00:58:30.727714Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":444219,"followers":540,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["21w38a","21w39a","21w40a","21w41a","21w42a","21w43a","21w44a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18-pre3","1.18-pre4","1.18-pre5","1.18-pre6","1.18-pre7","1.18-pre8","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18-rc4","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w11a","22w12a","22w13a","22w13oneblockatatime","22w14a","22w15a","22w16a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19-pre5","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-pre1","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1-pre3","1.19.1-pre4","1.19.1-pre5","1.19.1-pre6","1.19.1-rc2","1.19.1-rc3","1.19.1","1.19.2-rc1","1.19.2-rc2","1.19.2","22w42a","22w43a","22w44a","22w45a","22w46a","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3-pre3","1.19.3-rc1","1.19.3-rc2","1.19.3-rc3","1.19.3","23w03a","23w04a","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Wy5vNpIk","xvywwkcN","zZRdCapG","tO4Fg4Xo","61UhmWos","3OTdKL9g","WY3tHfDe","l9SfLZDA","tmHWmt1u"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com//data/hg77g4Pw/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"tmHWmt1u","project_id":"hg77g4Pw","author_id":"1OLhNZVQ","featured":false,"name":"1.8.0","version_number":"1.8.0","changelog":" * Add support for 1.20.3/4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-14T00:58:32.358306Z","downloads":202842,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"38b6d7939e3eb64d121d284ea7d7b04ab1863cb4dedaef2e85b11cee3f13f3e160839822402b94dc8da49ffaa10e2b901395300efc1f95bcf4dbf3024aeefa9a","sha1":"238b8ebc95100368951e0ff5ef2b16a1406e32f2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hg77g4Pw/versions/tmHWmt1u/no-telemetry-1.8.0.jar","filename":"no-telemetry-1.8.0.jar","primary":true,"size":89096,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["21w38a","21w39a","21w40a","21w41a","21w42a","21w43a","21w44a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18-pre3","1.18-pre4","1.18-pre5","1.18-pre6","1.18-pre7","1.18-pre8","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18-rc4","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"pDosJa6A","user":{"id":"1OLhNZVQ","username":"kb1000","name":"kb1000","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18211838?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-07T17:45:58.927355Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"no-telemetry-1.8.0.jar"},"mods\\lithium-fabric-mc1.21-0.12.7.jar":{"sha512":"91d78cf26f61876b1f5110e8aabb0189fe20fb669c2f2dd608416bce31c5c02eec9284ea418c405ab118562b5b8202c83154784bedf136f95727a86096e43430","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gvQqBUqZ","slug":"lithium","project_type":"mod","team":"peSx5UYg","title":"Lithium","description":"No-compromises game logic/server optimization mod","body":"Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-06-20T12:20:10.721384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":8257017,"followers":10142,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF","g2qXxjsR","fsK2ycFx","OC4JOVBe","my7uONjU","p25IJhj0","5a3sPIH2"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"my7uONjU","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.12.7","version_number":"mc1.21-0.12.7","changelog":"Lithium 0.12.7 fixes a few issues like sculk sensors not working after a chunk reload, too few chickens spawning from thrown eggs, fluids flowing towards the wrong hole and hopper minecarts making inventories have incorrect signal strengths.\nIn case you find any bugs, please report them at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/issues).

Configs should be migrated automatically, but please double-check whether any of your settings have been lost if updating from an older version!**\n\n## Features\n* Hide the crosshair when not looking at anything.\n* Hide or show it depending on what is being looked at.\n* Hide or show it depending on the currently equipped item.\n* Change the crosshair style for various situations.\n* Highly configurable.\n\n\n## Dependencies\nThis mod has been written for Minecraft >= 1.18.2.\n\n### Fabric version\n* requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n* from version 6 upwards, there is an optional dependency on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) for an ingame configuration screen\n* versions up to 5.5 require [ClothConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n* not required: [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for ingame configuration screen\n\n### (Neo)Forge version\n* from version 6 upwards, there is an optional dependency on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) for an ingame configuration screen\n* versions up to 5.5 require [ClothConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n\n## Mod Compatibility\nThis mod is very strongly coupled to vanilla Minecraft and has to hardcode a lot of interaction rules.\nThus, playing on a non-vanilla world will make the advanced features (context-dependent style) unreliable.\n\nIf you play with content mods, I recommend also installing [Dynamic Crosshair Compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshaircompat).\n\nIf you like dynamic UI elements, also check out my other mod [Auto HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/autohud) that extends dynamic behaviour to most of the HUD.\n\nDynamicCrosshair is currently not compatible with [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) (set its `enabledGui` setting to false to use its other features).","published":"2022-05-15T15:58:15.616504Z","updated":"2024-06-20T16:14:47.237770Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1780861,"followers":990,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["20bC160n","zJdREVIO","IXij3556","GkGeCML8","Jx2bA8fW","wX0EkxBG","UIPy4N6Y","u6oZjWMI","fwgB6xzq","rbuG9j4d","42x8E1l2","I3ozSAMN","UsI5wvVJ","Ex7R0pvH","bevKbyCT","C9PPMB8n","PUz7ZA69","DnIkKSEu","pKw86PFV","L1X78OCz","piwY5EqP","KdZ4nnQf","KCnkG2JM","vOx5xdxw","8cW3fCjp","OojuYcAm","SoTS6lF5","JZoNSBuy","N8iKshJP","vOMoMaOE","dSEqWeht","6x22u0T1","N3ze65Pu","8npnkOAY","JCXboA43","GwfJ6OPL","Q5W9seuT","MDMciNGY","DOxF1Usr","kVzqYdl5","hBz2RX9S","mqjafYwh","4XF7aDYQ","PDcGuAk3","dB2WXccw","oE6ADLJm","kBkiCSXP","KdRiHgim","Ngbs1lmT","p8mFGtnA","aT7BTmm2","7pIz7Bqe","5Rbzl2ai","HQNnNcTz","rzl6699L","b1MI0lNn","XXp55Fwj","aDXQGAnW","7LySfCZd","jwMWMQBh","3Rj2xiej","UrGLoyuO","jdd7O6I5","3BXMBlz0","Bgo2WQoz","4yNSnLVO","1HKz8pDD","cdWvTN6A","zma0Z88N","EJvo2aYT","SnHjacoX","L3cqS0s1","XxwoXEjt","uuUU7D4O","oGBybcWG","ha2GrJES","qSS7rxZG","kEvLJuWh","nhu2REPZ","AVTfWKih","kgZyjYD0","25UaxOtl","Q7LLoEz8","m758kre1","VlilX4g3","NpJSZyut","KLOwuZTc","siGvzEkG","pnStFlrz","zT12VILM","cR2jSKNv","S5sH62fG","UwrH9Wmp","PYMFga4Y","5ABRCqrl","svCwRMnR","wlHubjbx","me9sUGWp","GaDrUzLS","H2k9LvrK","B8uyNMAs","dHnDtwk3","AF6KCHFM","hW7fVOwD","xMsvqe7U","rOBAdNim","kV3gDaO6","Afi523uo","n7vNnWWX","hUj6v5bw","4ZNImu1V","7POTmnEb","HEyECMZD","BfvDyEpZ","B3fvmlGz","N4UrisV7","d5kHzOKy","ONH6Kqie","YZEVRL4i","J6uJYksd","h3YFJv7Z","ggoGe2EL","d1DZkc4J","1A4txeh8","lJhn7D9r","PlUmODOj","OvVeBAYa","RqouYFCA","yl7hdLYl","SgFUFMUD","iKnz6GmD","8x7iVA0A","DLtLuMzW","Vk1E4s8i","P70fS7oo","I1X42LQO","GxY44U4X","vW2z45Qw","gTjxflCI","8TADH0x4","nqnapHoW","4Oy7MCbK","j6JI3Ye5","AKd5ifeI","yI2M7Yw8","plDJhPkU","TBUQvVSc","wrKCukUs","ob3ideD4","1Cz6IyIk","z2n9Rh5O","83ZByaiI","vNnu7BoP","9TBX0qkD","U4QPyiFl","MneD8ExX","rp8sdu78","eCPSnqOy","eRIHItNH","6W6aaYaB","qumfSFz3","UrOG4IKT","PhOrxa0w","c7j11R0M","5OHmUXr7","dpEeHhG0","f5ZXlx3Q","CPQFd6yO","8QA0JAbA","E7hrxyB5","AjOd8bzj","cUGjuUBN"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZcR9weSm/8da8af58ca961f937bd05d41dcefa26be7b5c182.png"},"version":{"id":"AjOd8bzj","project_id":"ZcR9weSm","author_id":"bQuYYbeE","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric

page](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/isxander)\n\nA mod that adds the best **controller support** for Minecraft: Java Edition.\n\n</center>\n\n## Why Controlify?\n\n### User friendly\n\nDespite advanced settings available for power users, Controlify is beginner-friendly. It comes by default with\nbutton guides that appear across the whole game, helping you learn the controller layout. It also automatically detects\nyour controller's make and model, displaying relevant Minecraft-style button textures for a more intuitive experience.\nControlify \"just works\" out of the box, no need to spend tens of minutes getting your controller feeling like any other\ngame, thanks to the sane defaults I have created.\n\n### Feature-rich\n\nControlify strives to support all the added features that may come with your controller.\n\n- It supports gyroscopes natively, allowing for precise movements.\n- It comes with vibration/rumble support, making your gameplay more immersive (this is even missing on Bedrock Edition!)\n- Soon, HD haptics support for DualSense controllers, something never seen outside a Playstation game.\n- Support for non-standard joysticks such as flight sticks, given a small amount of setup.\n\n### Compatibility focus\n\nI, the developer have actively collaborated with fellow mod creators of performance mods like Sodium and Iris to\nensure seamless controller functionality throughout these custom GUIs. This will mean a more friction-free environment\nthat lets you focus on playing the game, instead of battling through the menus.\n\n## Q&A\n\n### Does it support Steam Deck?\n\n**Yes!** Controlify has been tested and is fully working on the Steam Deck, and works great. \nHowever, due to limitations with SteamOS, only Steam games can currently interface with the gyroscope and the\nback buttons directly, though [this is set to change in the coming months](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/9148)!\nFor now, you can use Steam Input to convert the gyro into a mouse input, and map the back buttons to other, more common\nbuttons.\n\n### Does it support my controller?\n\nControlify supports most controllers out of the box, any generic gamepad-like controller is bound to work fine, at\nleast in a basic state, giving inputs. Though, more strange and uncommon controllers such as handhelds like the ROG \nAlly may be missing features such as gyroscope.\n\nIf you are having trouble getting your controller working correctly, you can \n[join my discord server](https://short.isxander.dev/discord) or consult \n[the wiki](https://docs.isxander.dev/controlify/users/controller-compatibility-guide) for assistance.\n\n## Features\n\n### Controller vibration\n\nControlify supports controller vibration, which has not been seen before for PC versions of Minecraft,\nincluding Bedrock Windows 10 Edition. Configure the intensity of each vibration source, with\ncomplex vibration patterns for lots of aspects of the game (e.g. when you take damage).\n\n![picture of vibration config](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8a7809d07d9e1d9e3002007d7e5e13b73ce8fb5b.png)\n\n### Radial menu\n\n![radial menu showcase](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/e56d9be363b2b31440e16018cc01f197848b7ac6.webp)\n\nTo save up some buttons on your controller, dedicate some less-used actions to the radial menu.\nIt is fully customizable through the settings and intuitive to use. Any modded keybind is\ncompatible with this menu.\n\n### Built-in gyro support\n\nControlify has built-in support for controller gyroscopes, allowing you to make fine movements in-game\nwith your controller. This can be combined with [flick stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bw5xct/flick_stick_is_a_new_way_to_control_3d_games_with/) to be able to use a controller without\nthe compromise.\n\n### Container cursor\n\nJust like in bedrock edition, you can move a cursor across your inventory, and interact\nwith it in a controller-friendly way. With dedicated buttons for quick move, dropping etc. Controlify also comes with cursor snapping, so you don't need to be so precise with cursor movements.\n\n![container cursor screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/249a2cbaea9b374b33fe67717380e732693dd37a.png)\n\n### Controller identification\n\nControlify has the ability to identify the make and model of your controller automatically,\nand displays relevant button textures for your controller. This is also extendable by resource packs, changing up the button textures in a different style and adding some of your own, more niche controller identifiers.\n\n![demonstration of data-driven identification](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/ec1408d51787b87525b9fb0f2e56b54c5910d384.png)\n\n### Joystick support\n\nYou can connect any joystick to the mod and map it with your own names and textures, with an unlimited amount of inputs per controller.\n\n### Button guide\n\nThere is a simple overlay in-game that displays the buttons you can press\nbased on your player's state and look direction. This is useful for new players, who\nhave not yet memorised the controls.\n\n![image of in-game button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/57c41cee14680c74faf947c5cff355c0af4c35b3.png)\n\nAlso, some GUIs display controller buttons on elements that have a controller shortcut, to easily navigate with a controller like you should be able to.\n\n![image of in-screen button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/511e4182137bb27bbdf95539c8265b9af2038761.webp)\n\n### Containerised Controllers\n\nThis mod is built around the fact that each controller is completely separate, with it's own configuration, bindings etc.\nThis means it will be trivial to add support for split-screen play in the future.\n\n### Built for mod compatibility\n\nGUI operation has been abstracted into a simple API, which allows other mods to easily add support for their own GUIs,\nwithout convoluted support throughout the whole mod's codebase, making it difficult for third parties to integrate.\n\n![demonstration of dabr compat](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8ee5ec167bc5f8be96da725b10707094559138cb.gif)\n\n*Video recorded using do-a-barrel-roll with a Thrustmaster HOTAS flightstick*\n\n### Automatic controller deadzone calibration\n\nThe deadzone values of your controller are automatically calibrated, \nmeaning you don't have to worry about it.\n\n![image of calibration screen](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/f5f8e2a0a05e61adb95dd919760b424165ca5d14.png)\n\n## What is to come?\n\nA few features in various points in the horizon are:\n\n- Explicit Steam Deck support, with the ability to interface with its gyroscope and be able to handle its extra buttons on the back of the device.\n- A better way to change controller bindings, possibly a custom graphical GUI to pick what buttons do what actions, not the other way around.\n- Split-screen support of some degree.\n\n## Backports?\n\nThis mod is only and will only be available for **1.19.4** and above, this is because in 1.19.4, Mojang\nintroduced arrow key navigation which was easily ported to controller, below 1.19.4, this is not possible.\n","published":"2023-02-05T13:04:45.141986Z","updated":"2024-06-18T09:50:43.336709Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1383018,"followers":453,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w14potato","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["L5wBKwLP","O4X3TycI","XvbPbLuc","ViaGpYcG","mvoRZ4lr","TSgUsWWO","ZshsEOjG","OVsSpUi5","4eYmOLUb","jvUMhWpD","3L7GCFAd","v9yBe6Ye","hA4E3OIW","pKaQjz0y","60bCNc7N","FLIWpoEL","qHzBhRrd","h5ZThJ8W","FXJNOVCT","GJuiYIvz","uPbwSdJT","aT4dMJAD","xncNJgTg","y7xMOOMU","Oquy1mdB","L2JeMo5i","MSWp1Dsg","CzlyUU6C","QPb34aQS","5MMK5oJQ","E0IjfW25","1sbnpZZs","ATnQknqh","2oEDJIbx","6GKVGWLK","10SuJx9U","MZzohk5u","JbIeEVC9","Cs3ZJcvV","klbkkBCv","im0SBR8Y","Buc2lLKA","zYDV0AOF","C8BV2Qy4","Zd1jZT0f","MGnpqXdx","FeADDFg7","QpBHNrxY","fyZT7z6k","RJ59Pb7W","Zkei91rh","UrYvrQox","ba3azLbW","Q5nQC6JX","naETXOxy","cif1Amua","mpnMZdQU","FvddUeFM","cgUUVpN5","zPpBE48u","BtV20YRT","wd5HGBHn","33FaWQ20","UMr5nxvw","evZtJsLa","M4PuEYrI","DyraDYD7","kyNyEwKO","WtY06yYw","L888cMPM","3PavpR7i","xD4hE8Hq","xDTfzNlO","MTftatnR","ug0reHNd","zCjLVzXH","FeV5JYaC","65Aob1cE","GViwqlmh","KZm7UQoN","Wqjm6V7W"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/4f8cdb3933f9efa0c5dfd5574d3ad6b101c7f3ef.png"},"version":{"id":"zCjLVzXH","project_id":"DOUdJVEm","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"Controlify 2.0.0-beta.13 for Fabric 1.21","version_number":"2.0.0-beta.13+1.21-fabric","changelog":"# Controlify 2.0.0-beta.13\r\n\r\nThis version has the following targets:\r\n- Fabric 1.20.1\r\n- Fabric 1.20.4\r\n- NeoForge 1.20.4\r\n- Fabric 1.20.6\r\n- NeoForge 1.20.6\r\n- Fabric 1.21\r\n- NeoForge 1.21\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- **FINALLY FIX CRASHING!**\r\n  -

usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:45:34.688950Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":7322039,"followers":5617,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv","7slRrLO6","BkJB5PPB","wmIZ4wP4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"wmIZ4wP4","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":true,"name":"7.0.0 (Fabric)","version_number":"7.0.0","changelog":"- Update to 1.21.0\n- A slight/theoretical improvement of startup performance (embeddedt)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-16T09:45:35.402511Z","downloads":242904,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"95b18b0f1673bbbe328812c3052cc1a921591f0f","sha512":"0f2f9b5aebd71ef3064fc94df964296ac6ee8ea12221098b9df037bdcaaca7bccd473c981795f4d57ff3d49da3ef81f13a42566880b9f11dc64645e9c8ad5d4f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/wmIZ4wP4/ferritecore-7.0.0-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-7.0.0-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":117333,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-7.0.0-fabric.jar"},"mods\\c2me-fabric-mc1.21-0.2.0+alpha.11.106.jar":{"sha512":"15f6e952abad3323241b93c66979c9835e8a3ac70188ec0429d93ae389e65b7628589db7a728f841fa10f7ddb6c29dc2885028b9677ba8e4f39eca039926b75d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"VSNURh3q","slug":"c2me-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"3a9AGx2G","title":"Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (Fabric)","description":"A Fabric mod designed to improve the chunk performance of Minecraft.","body":"# Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (Fabric)\n\nA Fabric mod designed to improve the chunk performance of Minecraft.\n\n## So what is C2ME?\nC^2M-Engine, or C2ME for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of chunk generation, I/O, and loading. This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight).\n\n## What does C2ME stand for?\nConcurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.\n\n## So what is C2ME not?\n**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  \nAlthough it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  \nSo backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.\n\n## Support\nOur issue tracker: [link](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues)  \nOur discord server: [link](https://discord.gg/Kdy8NM5HW4)\n\n## Development builds\n**Note: Development builds may modify the config files in a way unreadable by previous versions.

animations to fire and related blocks as well as adding animations to things that previously didn't have any, now it overhauls almost all animated textures.\n\nAll animations are 32 or 64 frames long, loop seamlessly and are kept quite close to the vanilla artstyle.\n\nIn addition to that, practically all textures include Normal and Specular maps in the LabPBR standard, so affected blocks will have appropriately shiny reflections and a 3D effect with POM enabled.\n\nNote: not all shaders apply Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) to all blocks, and for a lot of them you have to enable the feature in the shader's settings first.\n\nCurrently affected textures:\n\n- Fire / Soul Fire\n- Campfire / Soul Campfire\n- Torch / Soul torch + Flame / Soul Flame particles\n- Candle particles\n- Explosion particles\n- Lantern / Soul Lantern\n- Jack o'Lantern\n- Water\n- Lava\n- Magma Block\n- Furnace\n- Blast Furnace\n- Smoker\n- Dispenser\n- Dropper\n- Nether Portal\n- Respawn Anchor\n- Crimson &

you would like to show a token of your appreciation for my work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying me a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n<a href=\"https://caffeinemc.net/donate\"><img src=\"https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3\" width=\"180\"/></a>\n\n---\n\n<center>\n <img

margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-06-29T13:45:48.189812Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":13794077,"followers":14580,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d","qhg37WBD","dNHeFokL","QHGZ9XSU","dEpHs0Hg","ygf8cVZg","OwLQelEI","RncWhTxD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"RncWhTxD","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"DzLrfrbK","featured":true,"name":"Sodium

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com//partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-06-14T21:20:00.112947Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":8463334,"followers":5560,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F","DHBIGCNn","F3RXDl1W","TOyoOLwn","7ZgGD02s","KRGWwoZW","1LVdHUaX","3VAtIiWX","cj8nR3eG","VgDjay7P","p2L3IXut","6U5rh26a","Gggee1My","LXLEbjiC","Bu3hSiJb"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Bu3hSiJb","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.6-1.21 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.6","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Update to 1.21\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.5...1.6.6","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-14T21:20:01.410934Z","downloads":292863,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ec25c5dacf85dbcbafab0c1039462fbe851ea5c32245fcd50ab0e98bbe2dda2ca8bb41ae222171c853e3f5c4c5a97c74d89570e695fe9dff0b90169471872e45","sha1":"cae57526503e6fff155d6168fd271c9f1f4d029b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/Bu3hSiJb/entityculling-fabric-1.6.6-mc1.21.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.6-mc1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":65363,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/poie5Iwy/107197d35f2df9a1b4f3f2c09ccbe65a1df9bd82.png","bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers.

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-07-01T18:34:04.893901Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6508011,"followers":6665,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7","VlLxDisa","XPsoVC5n","w4F7PG0f","gofbpynL","K4hsdO9H"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"K4hsdO9H","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.34 for Minecraft 1.21.x/Sodium 0.5.11","version_number":"1.0.34+mc1.21","changelog":"- Update to Sodium 0.5.11 (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.34+mc1.21","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-01T18:34:06.407606Z","downloads":45011,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"cf4641206fde618f194dc0a1064b1294e385d679","sha512":"e851adea39f2b2628aa02f77c23c9ce46eca94ed23799906fe6507947cd94f8ec9c567f8516cb5a55e4d917dd85cdbd3918120a8242af4f67bd33e5aca0b7703"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/K4hsdO9H/indium-1.0.34%2Bmc1.21.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.34+mc1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":104921,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"RncWhTxD","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.34+mc1.21.jar"},"mods\\wthit-fabric-12.2.2.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"e3f6adf1bc0db99243f40263403a0f5bcb4f7daedf0e93833d05f8ce4393636afb7439a229fa8af3ed66d9e13f71eea95e63bf17f09c84aae3256ee7c5b1f269","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"6AQIaxuO","slug":"wthit","project_type":"mod","team":"8SulWj9L","title":"WTHIT","description":"What the hell is that?","body":"# What The Hell Is That?\n\n[![fabric-api](https://images2.imgbox.com/8e/38/bfInI5qv_o.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n[![badpackets](https://images2.imgbox.com/1b/01/DfkvHGbQ_o.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/badpackets)\n\n> _“I am no longer interested in modding.”_\n> \\- TehNut\n\nHwyla is 🦀!!1 Now how the hell I can play Minecraft??!!1!    \nDon't worry, ladies and gentlemen, I got you covered!\n\nIntroducing WTHIT - a fork of [HWYLA](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/hwyla) by [TehNut](https://www.curseforge.com/members/tehnut), which is itself is a fork of [WAILA](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/waila) by [ProfMobius](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/ProfMobius)    \nWTHIT is a mod that adds an ingame tooltip with information about what block (or fluid) the player is looking at.\n\n![Touch some grass](https://images2.imgbox.com/24/15/jsEUqMnF_o.png)\n\nIt also has an API for other mod to add more info about their blocks.\n\n### Does WTHIT work with plugin X?\nOf course, although make sure to use Fabric Loader 0.11+.\n\n### Does it work with [insert minor version]?\nProbably.

high playercounts. \n\n**VMP is still in early development and things are expected to break. Please report any issues to our issue tracker.**\n\n## So what is VMP? \nVery Many Players, or VMP for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve general server performance at high playercount \n**without sacrificing vanilla functionality or behavior**.  \nFor the best performance it is recommended to use VMP with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium).\n\n## How VMP achieves its performance improvements?\n\n**Server-side game logic performance improvements:**  \n- Uses area maps to optimize nearby packet sending and player lookups\n- Uses cache to optimize entity trackers, fluid state lookups and ingredient matching\n- Optimizes entity iteration for collisions\n- Optimizes ticket propagator using MCUtil from the Paper project (patch licensed under MIT)\n\n**Client-side game logic performance improvements:**  \n- Makes time source to use built-in Java time source instead of GLFW via JNI calls\n\n**Networking performance & responsiveness improvements:**\n- Uses our own chunk sending mechanism (optionally with packet-level rate-limiting)\n- Adds packet-level per-player render distance\n- Makes vanilla tcp connections more responsive using packet priority from

standards of quality, and top tier optimisation. It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

On the right side of the screen, it shows more details about the mod, such as authors, a description, links, credits, and a button to configure the mod.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/images/155dd2b006883b168b1279ec0ff21e753946518b.png)\n\nMod Menu lets you view the mods you have installed and, if supported by the mod, enables quick and easy access to the mod's config screens.\n\nMod Menu also supports some more advanced features, such as translatable mod names and descriptions, support for [QuickText formatting](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/) in mod descriptions thanks to [Patbox](https://ko-fi.com/patbox)'s [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api), filters library mods out from regular mods, a mod update checker for mods hosted on Modrinth or that provide their own update sources, and deep configuration for all the features we provide.\n\n### Supported Platforms\nMod Menu is currently available for Fabric or Quilt on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14 or newer.\n\n## Developers\nMod Menu includes a number of APIs for developers to improve how their mod appears in Mod Menu. These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>","published":"2020-11-06T05:11:04.725058Z","updated":"2024-06-21T14:44:42.928177Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":8496300,"followers":10194,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.4","1.16.5","21w06a","21w14a","1.17-pre1","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w15a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w05a","23w07a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4-pre2","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4-pre4","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4-rc2","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w42a","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M3KFXLhq","DgzrfgAZ","O90fUm3q","zC13OZD9","7QWIhei3","79rtoAM6","kBofQyu4","TleLdS1A","PqgXyy3N","Mnl0OeFI","pxj9L3Vy","6YvLIUDN","wb5nbuL5","bPE0GIoY","pqlMITZQ","RIf7gcLA","Gz5wa6j2","EDbIonje","wRE7Emzz","mzVbb1XI","bHODZExo","a8bewBQT","NyFB1gry","oQr5VO7q","u955lyFM","E4QBMVtO","c6uDXZX8","bojzkt4w","4Ar2wg0k","G8sCBZ1X","JyL5b75a","GOPQZTVp","Wr4GfZdy","tlM0eBmY","DOitjZ89","XtL1i60M","VaZTuVan","FMqdptUn","aH8qgnVM","9xECQHnM","LVxVja5i","JOqf8AZn","WKj0jgYj","jZQ0G78K","PN4NcBa1","WkUCkcQA","3CD6YUw1","JPP6w2U1","eueI9czw","4JrWqhWw","Ui2loaCY","fw5MM4c4","6f25OJ7w","E4VKK6kQ","y8cYdaYa","GYRoFp1I","Tk7mCRX1","aShj7736","dP3zrFbp","cx9D94fU","pnFEFiHq","ybXxCvz4","NsD1IoUs","oU5qfeR6","2Ys0a7JE","8TOgNwQL","kQDE01D3","3umfHb6R","Gbkn1raO","d86kV6wd","NAs8eiQa","RxrqnH1z","GI1HTA1O","sI3kiPZE","4dReZoTJ","7mdkE3Od","qDXCbEz4","IPLgxPn7","V4hnfgRO","nVxObSbX","7kh2ofyR","eIrlBn1Z","yA8g3pEj","oqeCO757","4LXaG2xg","5qqTBb38","7E8dbVv0","5aw4r6fS","pyDmgV07","jRqFAHRH","4EOA40rU","gSoPJyVn","RtaGQNyd","sXVmzBDB","U31K6311","JYTmttex","pged5sGx","5e62j63G","nM5QaZNo","aMxXwo9x","3gwnUSKz","yjjsLqbS","RdCGzY7B","EuNUYds8","iZRiOnnj","M7LIgtWJ","RTFDnTKf","CtMNOUcV","zv46i3PW","VHzvWfY2","sLzitH81","id0aLmxO","eTCL1uh8","lMqXEzUw","jbNN4rAs","lEkperf6","sMAXpy0X","TwfjidT5","qpKaDJtd","Edgke5GX","tXEHCONL","4EYB2Bxx","fCQyI9Zj","sjtVVlsA","ua8KrvY4","mtTzRMV2","w3icASIi","VOHp29AO","ybV7vGT5","NgnZx44E","9FL4cmP7","KXx8jdVE","YLesFuAc","I7OSH8Gw","jnj30PDT","HLa8flfl","FawTQg29","lJ1xXMce","xhN1IvHi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/1b6bcdef5a3d92572f517122650716be7ec6458b.webp"},"version":{"id":"xhN1IvHi","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","author_id":"uF4fzWRt","featured":false,"name":"v11.0.1

Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nYou can also configure these settings for when you're idling (with a custom timeout) or while your laptop / handheld is on battery.  \nOptionally you may also display the current battery status on the in-game HUD and receive toast notifications about battery activity.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops\nrendering the world while it's being obscured by resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nEnabling the battery integration requires downloading an additional library at runtime.  \nThe mod contains the hashes for these files ahead of time and will verify them before usage.\n\nYou may disable this behavior in the mod's settings, or [install the library yourself](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/blob/main/docs/manual-natives-install.md) if you wish.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-06-30T17:40:08.218955Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4764770,"followers":3872,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P","TsACcqoR","zABNE034","RS3zegai","RCY49qLv","GzuwoJDO","U0tp6QIQ","mUoNvE18","ANanuCGR","XNQmNGUo","H3jM6EoR","aM6FmhY7","TLSV8m3h","LF4zDKeR","MbErXFSW","F7x3PReU","z9Xj6TuQ","NU3HRHXj","PyDPmXHD","wzp3skkc","aPRTCnlc","5fk6vDb1","U1cZ1TL7","8Hd00M1M","OjAim4Jo","ESoagl4C","pHWNKS7t","BNf9EmNl","JRl3y7rm","tEiWfX1N","uHnzIEQj","dliDieeY","wBsh7vqV","YF37wYKK","FonmH7YD","nTdQW3oL","KEs1F4M2","pMITUDDN","RYTZvQBc","TSSDSiZP","kbiP4CMi","qRc80r3o","jdsdQwkB","6FJB6Cff","DdDJ86cX","Xd3OWazo","eRegd530","jVjy8fjK","aLCEN12X","lSXJY9xl","FFFxotk0","JiiW7oPc","LlYJQJc0","imrXtkp1","GCbqf3Es","FxizL9t5","1nYqpxqz","ks5hKqn1","t4XJUfdJ","TfKF27MT","9gdFVbPJ","LP8Tu8Ll","G9r3hXu4","b1zBQl0B","5e8bQR5b","lb0ERSTU","zVtEuiz1","mXDQxXwm","dXkCBME4","oFct4NKJ","WJuoKsuM","AhFXokhh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"WJuoKsuM","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.6.0","version_number":"3.6.0","changelog":"-

Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n##

However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

API","description":"TheCSDev's personal library mod for the Minecraft modding enviroment.","body":"TCDCommons is a Minecraft modding API library that features its own GUI system and various events and hooks for the game, as well as utilities that may be useful to mod developers. This API's main purpose is to help optimize and speed up the development of mods, as well as to avoiding re-writing the same code for every mod that needs to do similar things. Please note that because this mod is a library, it may not offer useful front-end features to the user.\n\n## Dependencies\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n\n## Purpose\nAs mentioned earlier, the primary goal of this API is to enhance and accelerate the development of Minecraft mods, while also eliminating the need to rewrite redundant code for each mod that performs similar tasks. In the beginning, the initial purpose of this API mod was to provide a better the GUI system that's easier to work with, but it has since evolved to include various useful events, hooks, and utilities that may be commonly used.\n\n### Mods that use this API\nThis API mod is primarily used by [TheCSDev](https://github.com/TheCSDev) for developing [Better Statistics Screen](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats).\n\n## API features\n### Client-side\n- **GUI System**: A unique, user-friendly UI system that aims to be an improvement from the vanilla GUI system in terms of customization and flexibility.\n- **HUD Screens**: This feature enables the rendering of `Screen`s on the in-game HUD for visual enhancement. Please note, these HUD `Screen`s are for display purposes only and cannot be interacted with via user input.\n\n### Common-side\n- **Auto-config system**: Simplify the creation of JSON configuration files for your mod with this system. It automatically serializes fields of primitive types defined in the config `Class` during the saving and loading of configs.\n- **Event System**: Allows you to listen for various in-game events. It also allows you to define custom events for your mod, which other mods can listen to.\n- **Hooks**: Gain easy access to various game components with the help of these hooks.\n- **Networking**: This API comes with its own custom-payload-network, enabling other mods to communicate in both C2S and S2C directions over the game's network protocol.\n- **Utilities**: Benefit from a range of utilities, including various interfaces, enums, exception types, IO utilities, threading, and more. One such utility is a caching system that allows mods to perform asynchronous operations to fetch/load resources and cache them.\n\n## A simple introduction to the GUI system\nWith the GUI system, you can create your own custom GUI menus, in a simpler way that allows for more customization and flexibility.  \nIn the vanilla GUI system, we use `Screen`s. In this API's GUI system, we use what's called `TScreen`s.\n\nAll GUI components, including `TScreen`, and GUI widgets, can be found in the following package:\n`io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui`.\n\nBelow we will create an example `TScreen` implementation, with a simple button on it that does something when it's clicked:\n```java\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui.screen.TScreen;\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui.widget.TButtonWidget;\nimport net.minecraft.text.Text;\n\npublic final class ExampleTScreen extends TScreen\n{\n\t/*\n\t * `super` takes a `Text` argument for the screen's title\n\t */\n\tpublic ExampleTScreen() { super(Text.literal(\"Example TScreen\")); }\n\t\n\t/*\n\t * This is where the screen initializes its GUI elements.\n\t * We will add the button widget here.\n\t */\n\tprotected final @Override void init()\n\t{\n\t\t//create the button, and center it on the screen\n\t\tfinal var button = new TButtonWidget(\n\t\t\t(getWidth() / 2) - 50,  //the button's X position. we will center it\n\t\t\t(getHeight() / 2) - 10, //the button's Y position. we will center it\n\t\t\t100, //the button's width\n\t\t\t20   //the button's height\n\t\t);\n\t\t\n\t\t//define a text for the button\n\t\tbutton.setText(Text.literal(\"Click me\"));\n\t\t\n\t\t//now let's do something when the button is clicked\n\t\tbutton.setOnClick(btn ->\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t//print a simple message to the console\n\t\t\t//when the button is clicked\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n\t\t});\n\t\t\n\t\t//and finally, let's add the button to the screen\n\t\taddChild(button);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow, we need to open the screen and show it to the user. To do so, we use `MinecraftClient#setScreen(Screen)` (on Fabric), and we use `TScreen#getAsScreen()` to obtain the `Screen` reference. So our final code will look like this:\n```java\nfinal var tscreen = new ExampleTScreen();\nfinal var screen = tscreen.getAsScreen();\nMinecraftClient.getInstance().setScreen(screen);\n```\n\n## A simple introduction to the event system\nThe event system allows you to not only listen for various events already provided by this API, but it also allows you to create and invoke your own custom events.  \nBelow is an example of how you can create your own event, register and unregister listeners, as well as invoke the event:\n```java\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.event.TEvent;\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.event.TEventFactory;\n\npublic final class ExampleEvents\n{\n\t/*\n\t * This is how we create a custom event using this API.\n\t * Note that this event system is similar to Architectury API's event system,\n\t * but with some tweaks and additions done to it, for more flexibility.\n\t */\n\tpublic static final TEvent<Runnable> eSomething = TEventFactory.createLoop();\n\t\n\tpublic static final void registerAndUnregisterListener()\n\t{\n\t\t//we first define the listener that will be invoked when the event is invoked\n\t\tfinal Runnable listener = () -> { System.out.println(\"The event was invoked.\"); };\n\t\t\n\t\t//then, this is how we can register it\n\t\teSomething.register(listener);\n\t\t\n\t\t//and then, this is how we can unregister it\n\t\teSomething.unregister(listener);\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic static final void invokeEvent()\n\t{\n\t\t//we invoke the event by obtaining the \"invoker\",\n\t\t//and calling the functional interface's main function\n\t\t//(in Runnable's case, the main function is `run`)\n\t\teSomething.invoker().run();\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nI appreciate and value everyone's contributions to this mod, whether it involves translating the mod, offering feedback, or providing valuable suggestions. If you’d like to contribute, here are some ways you can get involved:\n1. If you’re proficient in multiple languages, consider helping me translate the mod into other languages.

The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.\n\n### Dependencies (v3.11+)\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Better Statistics Screen](#) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n| [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37) | Required as of `1.21` | Required as of `1.21` |\n| [Roughly Enough Items (REI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/nfn13YXA) | Optional | Not needed |\n| [Mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mOgUt4GM) | Optional | Not needed |\n\n## Features\nThis mod aims to improve on the existing features, as well as add additional features that may futher be helpful in tracking and managing one's statistics.  \n  \nNote that any optional features that this mod adds to the game, such as the \"/statistics\" command and the \"Stat announcement system\", may be disabled in the config or though the in-game mod settings menu.\n\n### The `/statistics` command\n**Alt command:** `/stats`  \nThis is an optional feature that adds a command that allows people (with sufficient permission levels, such as OP) to manage and view player statistics through commands. This feature may also be useful for writing datapacks that may wanna read as well as manage player statistics.  \n\n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*\n\n**The command syntax is the following:**\n- `/statistics clear <targets>`\n- `/statistics edit <targets> <stat_type> <stat> (set|increase) <value>`\n- [ex. general stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:custom minecraft:jump set 123`\n- [ex. item stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:used minecraft:wooden_shovel set 123`\n- [ex. mob stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:killed minecraft:zombie set 123`\n\n### The \"Stat announcement system\"\nThis is an optional server-sided feature that broadcasts special messages when players do certain things or achieve certain stats or \"milestones\". As of `v3.9.7`, the SAS announces when players achieve certain stats for the first time, such as for example \"Mining their first diamond\", or \"Crafting their first item of a specific type\", and so on..  \n  \n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*  \n  \n![The SAS in action](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/assets/66475965/3467ecae-5393-4fa9-9bf3-5146cc07f7b7)\n\n### The \"General\" statistics tab\nThis tab does not add nor show anything special regarding general statistics other than the redesigned UI layout. The filters menu features a way for you to hide all general statistics that are currently set to '0', as well as a search bar that will help you look for a specific statistic.  \n  \n![General statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/f612dcb73d9e4ffc4ca0494559a31221396c2435.png)\n\n### The \"Items\" statistics tab\nThe items tab displays items in a visual grid of items, similar to how an inventory screen does it. The items are categorized in item groups, just like they would be in the creative inventory menu. All items you interacted with are shown in this tab. This will hopefully help you find the items you are looking for easier. The search field in the filters menu can be used to look for specific items. To see a statistic for an item, place your cursor over the said item, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard, and a tooltip text will display the statistics. The \"Show item names\" checkbox defines whether or not the tooltip will also show the item name.  \n  \n![Item statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5ef05e79400d4e0d386f899dc1849f72731c0372.png)\n\n### The \"Mobs\" statistics tab\nSimilar to the \"Items\" tab, the \"Mobs\" tab will also show mobs in a grid. The mobs are visually rendered on the GUI screen, so it is easier for you to find the mob you are looking for, and because it looks nicer. Just like with the items tab, to see the statistics for a given mob, place your cursor over the said mob, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard. A tooltip text will show you the statistics.  \n  \n*Note that due to technical limitations in my programming, some mobs may fail to render properly, and some mobs may even appear as \"plain text\" instead of their 3D model due to errors in my rendering method.*  \n  \n![Mob statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd6c360face8ba7fcf05224a08044614c7eb9496.png)\n\n### The \"Food & drinks\" statistics tab (formerly \"A balanced diet\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"A balanced died\" advancement. It does that by displaying all food items in grouped grids, similarly to how the \"Items\" tab does it. This tab will show you all food items, even the ones you haven't interacted with, and will also highlight the foods you already ate before, helping you identify which foods you need to eat next to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that this tab may not precisely tell you exactly which foods you do and do not need, as that kind of criteria is controlled \"server-side\", and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all foods are shown instead.*  \n\n![Food & drinks statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/9e3478d0573276349e9842337de3cf598dcf75db.png)\n\n### The \"Hostile creatures\" statistics tab (formerly \"Monsters Hunted\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"Monsters hunted\" advancement. It shows you a grid of mobs similarly to the \"Mobs\" tab, except the mobs shown on this tab are hostile creatures you have either killed or are yet to kill. Similarly to the \"Food & drinks\" tab, any mobs you have killed will be highlighted in this tab, helping you easily see which mobs you need to kill next in order to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that just like with \"Food & drinks\", the criteria for getting the advancement is controlled server-side, and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all hostile creatures are always shown.*  \n\n![Hostile creatures statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fe98cfce86319282774228f4f4c81748eaa00139.png)\n\n### In-game config menu\nA menu that lets you configure the mod in-game. Nothing more or less.  \n\n![In-game config menu](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/7413856bcf4e799b7e265bcf732f17cbb1e2e7c2.png)\n\n### MCBS files\nThis is an additional feature that aims to let people save a \"snapshot\" of their current statistics, into a file, which can then be opened later or shared with other players.  \n  \n*Note that opening an MCBS file does not \"override\" you current stats, as it only shows you what your stats looked like at the time you saved the MCBS file.*\n\n![Saving a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/315ca6da7dcb943b3435c6a11917393786ae4367.png)\n![Opening a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5f1855efceb8870339456bb1d3e8235d795f3cfe.png)\n\n### The statistics hud\nThis is another additional feature that allows you to \"pin\" any stat to the \"in-game-hud\", where you can then look at any statistic of your choosing as you play the game. To pin a stat, simply right-click it with your mouse (hold down shift as well if you have REI installed).  \n\n*Note that due to technical limitations, pinned statistics update occasionally by default, and will not update \"live\" unless this mod is installed on the server-side as well and the \"live stat updates\" is enabled on the client-side.*  \n\n![Pinning stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/3c7e15962f4c8a2268bc5da9a2e7d97ae7850fb6.png)\n![Configuring pinned stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/681f25b72304d0fdde71ab3104d51fab506c3c34.png)\n![What pinned stats look like during gameplay](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd7f29e99ed6b73981b2e2cbcdb4eddb93a2bbcb.png)\n\n## Some QnA\n- What about Minecraft Forge?\n    - I have no plans on making future ports to Forge or any other mod loaders. See [GitHub Issue #100](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/100) for more info. However, not all hope is lost! [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/u58R1TMW) is a mod that lets people run Fabric mods on Forge! Please check it out. Also keep in mind the mod is in beta (as of me writing this), so please don't be harsh towards the mod's developers while expecting the mod to work 100% of the time.\n- Port to older Minecraft versions?\n    - Nope. Same reason as the 'Minecraft Forge' one.\n- I can't pin stats to the hud. I right-click them, but REI shows up instead. How do I pin stats?\n    - Hold down the left shift button while right clicking a stat. That is, if you have REI installed.\n\n## Credits\nThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and helped translate the mod to other languages! And a special thank **you**, the person reading this, for choosing to use this mod! (Well, thank you even if you're just checking out the mod and not actually using it. That also means a lot!)\n\n### The showcase YouTube video I recorded\nI decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.\n\n### The screenshots I took\nResource packs and shader packs used at the time of screenshotting.\n- [Complementary shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)\n- [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/5aPp18Lx)\n- [3D crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/PgpTtNoI)\n- [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/6SLU7tS5)\n\nSorry if I missed any. I had too many of them applied at once.","published":"2022-09-02T19:38:08.030776Z","updated":"2024-07-03T11:08:00.796874Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1655385,"followers":1507,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w13a","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["EnelgdHp","Fk8W9xAv","8RhZhQYw","94aapoJA","4rdXgAx2","uLo8KWrK","SoYOLyoj","WEev32xa","fvo5X8Xj","9eNc6jlA","SAGXYRQW","qgsvDAFG","gz1quzFI","1dR0gD57","307623Pb","F7rjMuqu","WajeE658","H4ve3iC9","oKip6o69","fbwYDHTx","PuyUL15E","wcdeU0Uk","c02NBGoz","YwgivtRx","aMHvwPf2","W7pDuGqC","E1EeTCzR","OFa15O41","QNNqgAdx","nJhfzkvB","GH2n9Xmp","z12xxYRe","823VmOAv","Ufs79Xwx","AKglt1TW","NwsPvqFn","JCedcydw","ytM62cvx","M5IJOqMW","s8PMW1n2","HMC7jXEQ","RM7Dy7vu","9PPcvO4i","UrwGLSJI","LBO8kIEp","DA4J8QTI","zuI0rtcT","oCC1YLFI","5rMFdCwJ","tGhUGisK","sb3SaBaE","QZwSwiZR","18RwTRug","vsM2NrtL","jRrE1yaP","fVJ0IIJU","yebgi9T4","w3dUagqG","8Yswy53a","h7aGFS6n","A6kv9M3f","ng46cYL0","SbiaYJpr","ODcKksFu","cTVirG90","APEn5ML0","eGcQh6sR","VXZAyG4G","dx8kubiy","OQQwqPed","77XYVAe5","5bD14l3I","pQEGz8q4","JwLjCwiB","9Nle6p3Y","XWYy9iPd","saxPMWUK","WNvtlvrR","UPxGVo2j","HZMdcy1s","flzNW6MC","rTAZet3B","S8zvr548","Ah2PN5Vd","TcpdjZq3","TJVb61wk","IRAj3Zja","rCdw3Yao","RanY7iKp","I0YaiUKC","5RoB9ulm","itZVnHEf","yLNRroby","LiBg6GMi","3Dz7ZYBA","WLBCUkWu","uxQfDyI7","UivJDox9","e3q6lD9z","zrhRDvws","rGCv0cOY","qZJRvw7w","1weQYuP0","LyAkMd7b","CdN82lOX","qGf3pduz","KOUA7KHm","E5zqzlew","hsjPjr1l","eZ6vxjVH","CTYD1jrY","hsA6tx3U","2d67uRLI","lwRehylW","9mc9uiOb","PoHesack","qdiBvpLD","cxqQA00g","nRGVPeao","sogTh4cI","cJbr3hAU","KWuKt0ct","1LjgPqG5","71Ie3Fad","25Kl4Bo0","RP77Jp7s","bGYkCuJ4","v5KSPfZS","j9GJlHWA","wyQ2nH56","tEseitwF","N1acUGhP","u3oGwdmM","u5ABQXZg","vnJYWJ44","4lGy0aaq","LsbNVGUA","7E0ghj2a","NNrDcObC","7KRgzNWt","vrAjuu6V","fA72myNS","RLXEmLF9","geaZKRmc","HyPBt1Fe","dqzzU5Hg","p5Xw2LiZ","hZs482mC","6g4qy5hA","L2ERNR7d","11foeqox","Njd7x8bl","5Ci8FUbU","W6ptfTp3","YlLOkKf9","gDMj0yIi","SHsaZzMU","abEltCPM","14Cmm7Ff","C1VysDYt","A0tzMwVS","DBDZAhwS","JdB9dfE9","ZpFQOEiP","2n9CpLEp","qkfpsoTv","LjUuZyjm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"LjUuZyjm","project_id":"n6PXGAoM","author_id":"j0Ha6a2h","featured":false,"name":"BSS (fabric-1.21) - v3.12-alpha.1","version_number":"3.12-alpha.1+fabric-1.21","changelog":"**Note: Requires TCDCommons v3.12 or higher**\n\nThis Alpha release features a bit of an earlier version of a new feature that's coming to 3.12, \"Quick share\".  \nThis new feature allows people to share their statistics with others, with just one click of a button.\n\nThe goal with this release is solely to allow people to test out the feature early, and let me know what they think.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Features\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\n## 🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

attention to detail, high standards of quality, and top tier optimisation. It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks. (Choose Iris if you are unsure)\n<br>\n**-** Then you need to launch the game, and get to the Shaderpacks/Shaders menu in Video Settings.\n<br>\n**-** Open the shaderpacks folder by clicking the button in the menu.\n<br>\n**-** Download Complementary Shaders and put it in the shaderpacks folder. (Please don't unzip the file)\n<br>\n**-** Get back in the game, and choose Complementary in the shaderpacks menu.

This mod will cancel lightmap updates if nothing that changes brightness (e.g. gamma slider, potion effects) has changed. \n- **Sky color calculation optimizations**<p>\n  Minecraft uses `CubicScampler.sampleColor` every frame to calculate the current sky color. This function loops 216 times to factor in surrounding biomes-even if all surrounding biomes are identical or have identical sky colors. This mod makes this function only get called if you are between biomes with different sky colors and only makes it get called every tick. Otherwise, a shorter, simpler and faster sky color calculation is used.\n- **Don't do debug logic if we don't need to**<p>\n  Minecraft has four debug renderers that can be activated with a debug server: bees, game events, game test and villager AI. Even if there's nothing to process, the logic for these debug renderers are still executed. This mod will only execute them if debug is enabled and there is data to process.\n\n<p>\nThat's all the major ones, at least.\nYou can disable any optimization in the config file if you need to.\n</p>\n\n## But how much does it help?\n*(tested on my own PC with an RTX 3060, intel i7 12700 and 4GB of allocated ram on Fabulously Optimized)*<p>\nWithout toasts, it goes from 1926-1955 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/523f9117-5dfb-469a-a1e3-2e5c32597057\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 2008-2023 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/a27fcfab-c9ac-4fb0-9dfa-fc2efc61b2f4\" width=\"256\"><p>\nAnd with toasts, it goes from 1351-1384 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/859f710b-036e-4080-9e94-ceaaf5a9bbf9\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 1414-1458 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/5a01d4a7-0789-465d-a08f-aaa54386deb7\" width=\"256\"><p>\n\n## Dependencies?\nNone.\n\n*(Also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/badoptimizations)!)*","published":"2023-12-03T23:38:30.615171Z","updated":"2024-06-15T06:13:29.544303Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1073728,"followers":475,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["4iRxgKYG","7EtZn21b","LvWnmLrW","CMQm449N","QPNT0tat","ww747oVi","R5epQB48","7mkIryQX","N83O7mRY","tPcndzIs","Rya4Prxg","P1VV7yAB","osrW6S8S","5iiizW8v","NPtJUzCQ","xrCxVWjv","csMggyw8","pYctvKKH","ByJJBuGh","frxUrBuZ","f80P5Er3","ajq5p3Cr","lVUqygYP","6qzarF6r","py5wZc1k","9vTW5SzW","ouYuE0eo","RppoOA91","o0gYJCDi","x9zMt7t7","Tyi2q14M","QFKaP0NG","PY8WFC19","YPx40hkR","WZB4pQ3u","l5RWBdez","yK1K2DcH","pNkHByNm","tfPcVhXP","NepFM2XR","74fRkfKB","PXrqBQZG","O6GYJnvX","vJEBno3y","84AEMPgv","DkQi3drk","KWwNfrjN","wlqlZ5hE","37M8Rd4S","KeVurIPw","8JJc3kIM","r88RTaW8","Go4FoZir","dAVlOLS6","cpFHy43X","bOuSwVyc","aKkny43Y","918aozAU","zLWPzGCh","Gsub2Uuo","ydYsXrGL","eT6Jsaq5","zZYSuJ5b","bpmrr094","lqrDW4fz","V222vBVT","HPufvV6Z","2Aygc6Sx","faqoQF36","QitPsCFU","fPU2qEYo","Yvu9MYgX","YIdCgnz1","LJwG3VNe","eCxTPnVB","iULB5JCQ","FPQdPmAW","xhGlhCut","GydKiUd0","iXgx6zFq","j3hOwXG0","XYBqWKD2"],"icon_url":null},"version":{"id":"XYBqWKD2","project_id":"g96Z4WVZ","author_id":"MtdsrsRk","featured":true,"name":"2.1.4 (1.21)","version_number":"2.1.4","changelog":"I just can't catch a break can I.  \n- Fix an issue where light/sky colors wouldn't react to time properly  \n\nHOPEFULLY no more critical issues after this-then 1.19 versions won't receive any more updates.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-15T06:13:30.505591Z","downloads":69973,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"2338c2382537de70388a2f0f2a7b60ee0512afce","sha512":"6f12d5d7b75ed38f006e4c1e176a2308bf78e6bb5d49601152d7a8fa8e576b3e884bd04fcfb976b82fb67a62408e7efcff3ecc6844cea62b07d4b0538b9f0549"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/g96Z4WVZ/versions/XYBqWKD2/BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.21.jar","filename":"BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":91292,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8syA22fZ","user":{"id":"MtdsrsRk","username":"thosea","name":"Thosea","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/MtdsrsRk/3f5159d38faa7b19426cc1ea6c76036a4e509c18.webp","bio":"@thosea on discord","created":"2023-08-22T16:13:26.975044Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.21.jar"},"resourcepacks\\Eyeless Fresh Moves v3.0.1.zip":{"sha512":"979fbf02d8e0b026985b0a91f3380925dae6fb1ee26a414a340476ecba7054bc305b7097ace4408ba16709fc6282031f13dd00630bba3c4570e0a0ed55ff92e9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"slufHzC2","slug":"tras-fresh-player","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"WJNOUval","title":"Fresh Moves","description":"This is a Player Animation texture pack for forge and fabric, it uses ETF and EMF, it works with many mods that use animations for your character like emotes, for example Parcool, Quark, Better Combat, Essential...","body":"**You need the LATEST versions [Entity Model Features](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features) (+v2.0.2), [Entity Texture Features](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-texture-features-fabric) (+v6.0.1) to use this pack.

Notice that it has the eyebrows at the third position.\n\nThe version of this pack with animated eyes (Expressive Fresh Moves.zip) will also have the extra pixels on the default Minecraft skins (Steve, Alex, Makena, Efe, Noor, Kai, Ari, Sunny, and Zuri) as an example. ****\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Features in Fresh Moves:**\n-This resource pack overhauls the idle, walking and swimming animation and gives some othe details to the player.\n\n![Running](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/22d2e93235eb421566c030489277234dfadc7e73.png)\n![Idle](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/c343e36d2c1492bcc47cf27cb5d26394cde89109.png)\n \nThis resource pack has been made with special compatibility for [Parcool](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/parcool), [Quark's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark) emotes, [Not Enought Animations](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-enough-animations), [Amendments](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/amendments) and [Real Camera](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/real-camera) mod.

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2024-06-20T08:13:36.511097Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2629642,"followers":1375,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3","BEeRgTMS","kST7zzvZ","GkLb4bRl","og4A1nN8","FUZo6yCk","g77ke7PC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"FUZo6yCk","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.21-1.6","version_number":"1.21-1.6","changelog":"changed default configs to have quad expansion off\nYou can turn it back on yourself if you want in the configs","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-19T22:11:46.320409Z","downloads":100435,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"5e6c5027420dd4fc0a2aa628edbb75f9dd468f14451766f582018eaa89d69e345c45452cc57c9730d4298a33e698a7832269b491f7cecbb11cc46d084825f2b3","sha1":"b8069f2a672abdea1112daa6d716a0e482cf61ea"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/FUZo6yCk/modelfix-1.21-1.6-fabric.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.21-1.6-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":62761,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.21-1.6-fabric.jar"},"mods\\skinlayers3d-fabric-1.6.6-mc1.21.jar":{"sha512":"73a527fc664d8de41e7c176d34bb969807e4be6cdfec1e1140043606bd13911c9d84c619cd4fa9ba9b1a210d5904b9f7df2f21ad737ebbd4c48dcf11aa084b31","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"zV5r3pPn","slug":"3dskinlayers","project_type":"mod","team":"3Lp8TMMC","title":"3D Skin Layers","description":"Render the player skin layer in 3d!","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/3d-Skin-Layers/1.19/img/MC_NU_HEADER.png)\n\n# 3d Skin Layers\n\n[![Downloads](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_521480_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/skin-layers-3d)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tr7zw/3d-Skin-Layers/1.19/img/MC_NU_BANNER1.png)\n\nReplaces the usually flat second layer of player skins with a 3d modeled version.

Now rewritten from scratch in Kotlin for cleaner code, better performance, more features, and extensibility.\nOther mods' developers can add their custom containers and customization options. See documentation link above.\n\n[Supports most OptiFine GUI resource packs](#supported-resource-packs).

OptiGUI resource packs are more flexible than OptiFine resource packs.\nSee documentation link above to get started.\n\n## Supported resource packs\n\nExcluding vanilla resource packs (which don't container OptiFine or OptiGUI-specific files)\n\n* [Colourful Containers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-gui/)\n* [Colourful Containers Add-On](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/updated-colourful-containers-light-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Colourful Containers Dark Mode](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-dark-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Animated RGB GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/optifine-animated-rgb-gui) ¹\n* [NEON20 ANIMATED](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/neon20-animated-optifine/)\n* [Rybo's Enhanced GUI](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/rybo-s-enhanced-gui/)\n* [Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/animated-fox-guis-1-16-x/) ¹\n* [\\[DARK\\] Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fox-4931933/) ¹\n\n¹ see FAQ for animation support\n\nThis list is not exhaustive.

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

This is important!\n\nThe version support numbers are strict! <br>\nIf a version says it supports MC 1.18.1 it will NOT work on 1.18.2! <br>\n\nAnd: the mod is still in alpha.

Forge and Fabric are both in the same jar. \n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Yes, but only with certain shaders. <br>\n- Optifine: DH partially works with forward rendered shaders.\n- Iris (and equivalent ports): DH 2.1.0+ only works with Iris 1.7+ and only with shaders built with DH support in mind. \n  - DH 2.0 and older don't work with Iris.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes.\nAlthough currently the mod is only client side so you have to explore chunks for the mod to use them.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/1-general/General\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-general.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/2-problems-and-solutions/Problems-and-Solutions\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-mod-support.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/4-mod-support/Mod-Support\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-problem.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a>\n\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Discord:\nJoin our Discord for news, updates, and help:\ndiscord.com/invite/xAB8G4cENx\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Support us:\n\nIf you want to help with development, join our discord and let us know!\n\nOtherwise if you can't help with development but still want to support Distant Horizons, check out our donation page:\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/distanthorizons","published":"2022-01-23T05:46:55.026356Z","updated":"2024-06-26T00:01:35.253383Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1421789,"followers":4542,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["wTtGd14B","DezAJ8u0","x3yEpy5p","ruuHY8OM","2vU5aacx","28PMiKSx","JseXmZpZ","AHJ0mNv1","k5oJ58yR","JV4jiA1y","qLXa9pDD","FnXdZRJ7","z6ZQBfWx","Pn7d9p7i","KrGwvvWA","6ZzUWKxi","KEWnNiUP","8ctYpkCM","QdxhQapq","McgrFayO","ArHY9dmV","38p3qCjb","yEUygWBv","P4psgCf3","xBHpiuwg","qT4v0LBa","QLrBlpYY","mxvQyywi","oYqpZUCe","yqCZe843","f5ukM1Qm","mjIVHovM","zhP09epG","nLshnREE","s3sNOqn2","aOWEQ1nc","r8OABIpt","fAVxiMK6","3yoHVgxZ","6pQHeelV","VnKmHe1I","P8tkVBXd","XLWDF2NT","hsb0wIeu","xbRHd92j","3B15sgvb","HbiwjG8y","13xaVT4W","rvEYu8Iv","pllFih8s","TSpsYWzW","8z7hnzLN","T98hbY34","OwcStAhe","VPs4DNbT","YN8jhotL","9dof9TBP","NCz4yZ3v"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uCdwusMi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"NCz4yZ3v","project_id":"uCdwusMi","author_id":"ksmgF6Gt","featured":true,"name":"2.1.2-a -
